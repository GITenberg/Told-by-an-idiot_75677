summary: '"Told by an Idiot" by Rose Macaulay is a novel written in the early 20th
  century. The story begins in a Victorian setting, focusing on the Garden family,
  particularly around the figure of Mr. Aubrey Garden, an Anglican clergyman who frequently
  experiences crises of faith. The characters include his six children and their mother,
  each with their distinct personalities and perspectives on faith, politics, and
  social issues. The book captures the family’s struggles with changes in belief systems
  and the implications of their father''s shifting religious convictions.  At the
  start of the novel, the eldest child, Victoria, expresses frustration over her father''s
  recurring loss of faith, leading the family to consider joining the Ethical Society.
  The narrative introduces her siblings, including the rationalist Maurice and the
  idealistic Stanley, who embody the tensions of their time—balancing personal beliefs
  against societal expectations. The discussions among the family members reveal their
  differing worldviews, highlighting the interplay between modernity, tradition, and
  the quest for meaning. This opening portion sets the stage for a social commentary
  that explores themes of faith, identity, and familial dynamics in the face of change.
